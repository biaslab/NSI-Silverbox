## System identification of Silverbox

Silverbox is a system identification benchmark problem, found at [http://nonlinearbenchmark.org/](http://nonlinearbenchmark.org/). It is a damped harmonic oscillator with a nonlinear spring coefficient, driven by a control signal.

We are inferring parameters of the dynamics from paired input-output data, using variational free energy minimization.
